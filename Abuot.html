<p>Real Madrid have officially announced on Thursday the signing of Brazilian 16-year-old prodigy, Endrick. The Palmeiras striker will stay in Brazil until the summer of 2024, by which time he will have turned 18 and will be able to join Los Blancos.

    Endrick will follow in the footsteps of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes, both of whom also signed for Real Madrid at a young age.
    
    Los Blancos signed the youngster in exchange of 35 million euros, but his transfer could reach 60m euros if certain objectives are fulfilled in the future.
    
    Won the race against European powerhouses
    Real Madrid were not the only European elite club who expressed their interest in signing Endrick. Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Barcelona also tried to sign the Brazilian forward, but Los Blancos won the race to acquire his services.
    
    Real Madrid officials were the first club to invite the player and his parents to visit the Spanish capital and the club's training ground in Valdebebas. Their relationship was gradually consolidated until the final agreement was reached.
    
    
    Potential superstar
    Endrick, who already discussed about a potential move to Real Madrid in an exclusive interview for MARCA, has already showed glimpses of his talent in Brazil.
    
    His entourage has made clear that the Brazilian prodigy is not willing to coincide and compete for a spot in attack with another superstar, such as Erling Haaland. However, Real Madrid agreed on the condition proposed by Endrick's representatives.
    
    The club believe that the future attacking trident of Vinicius, Rodrygo and Endrick will mark an era, with the first two having already established themselves into the ream.
